You'll be shook for this shakshuka. This meal is *so* good! Ahh! I absolutely love shakshuka, and when you make this variation with ground turkey it really takes it to the next level and turns it from a breakfast dish to an all-day dish. I've had this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and love it more and more each time.

You can make this two ways. On the left is with __ tomatos and on the right is with whole tomatoes:
