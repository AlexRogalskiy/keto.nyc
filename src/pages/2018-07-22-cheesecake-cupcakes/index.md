## You'll Need:

- 1/2 cup almond flour
- 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) melted butter
- 2 (8 ounce) packages of cream cheese, softened
- 2 eggs
- 3/4 cup [erythritol sweetener](https://amzn.to/2OwdAZD)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 large strawberries, sliced
- Sugar-free whipped heavy cream (love [this](https://www.landolakes.com/products/whipping-cream-and-half-half/aerosol-whipped-cream/) stuff!)

## Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners
2. Mix almond flour and butter together in a bowl, spoon into the bottom of the paper liners and press into a flat crust
3. Beat cream cheese, eggs, erythritol, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth; spoon into the muffin cups
4. Bake in the preheated oven until the cream cheese mixture is nearly set in the middle, (15 to 18 minutes)
5. Let cupcakes cool at room temperature until cool enough to handle. Refrigerate 8 hours to overnight before serving.
6. When the cupcakes are set, apply a thin coating of whipped cream and lay the sliced strawberries on top
7. Top it off with more whipped cream!
