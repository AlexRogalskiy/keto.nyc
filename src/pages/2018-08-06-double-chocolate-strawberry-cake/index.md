## You'll Need:

### For the Dough:

- 1/2 cup coconut flour
- 1/2 cup cocoa powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 cup [powdered erythritol](https://amzn.to/2OwdAZD)
- 6 large eggs
- 6 tbsp coconut oil, melted
- 6 tbsp coconut milk
- 8 Large Strawberries

### For the Icing:
- 1 cup coconut milk (full fat)
- 1 1/4 cups [Lily's chocolate chips](https://amzn.to/2nuCwVW)
- 1/4 cup powdered erythritol

## Directions:

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line and grease *two* 8 x 8-inch square pans and set aside. 
2. In a high-speed blender or food processor, combine all your ingredients and blend until a thick batter remains. Ensure you regularly scrape down the sides to ensure all the ingredients are fully incorporated. *Add baking powder last*
3. Pour half of the batter into each lined pan and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a skewer comes out the center.
4. Once cool, mix coconut milk, erythritol, and chocolate chips together to make the frosting. Refrigerate to firm up slightly.
5. Once more firm, apply a thick layer frosting on top of one of your cakes sheets. Stack the other sheet of cake on top.
6. Continue to heavily frost all over the cake and top with sliced strawberries.
